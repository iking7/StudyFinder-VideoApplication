End-to-end encryption in video conferences has recently become more paramount than it ever has been. With the surge of COVID-19 cases, video conferencing is being utilized across the world as a means of safe and contact-free communication. Without proper end-to-end encryption, hackers can hijack calls and eavesdrop on sensitive information. Particularly in research and in the medical field, it is important that participants’ and patients’ information is kept safe. The focus of our project is to lay the foundation for safe video calling.

The longterm goal is to create a more secure video conference platform for medical professionals to conduct check-ups, meetings, or research with patients/participants who are at home. For people who do not have easy access to transportation and for people living in high risk COVID areas, individuals need an accessible way to communicate. Additionally, client information can be used by outsiders to harm the patients/participants in numerous ways, and there aren’t any specialized video tools that benefit researchers and medical professionals.
